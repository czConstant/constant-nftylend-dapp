        <h3>NFTy-Lend Platform Agreement</h3>
        <p>(Last updated FEBRUARY 22, 2022)</p>
        <p>
          Please read this NFTy-Lend Platform Agreement (the "Agreement")
          carefully. This Agreement is a legally binding agreement between you
          (" you", "your" or "User") and Non-fungible Technologies, Inc.
          ("MyConstant" or "we" or "us"). By clicking or tapping any button or
          box marked "I Accept," "I Agree," or "OK" (or a similar term) in
          connection with this Agreement, or by using or accessing the NFTy-Lend
          Platform (as defined below), you acknowledge and agree to this
          Agreement and you confirm that you are of legal age where you live and
          have the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Agreement is between you and MyConstant concerning your use of
          certain MyConstant services in connection with its decentralized,
          peer-to-peer lending platform that allows the creation of loans
          collateralized by non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"), fungible tokens and/or
          other crypto-assets (the " NFTy-Lend Platform"). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
          AGREE THAT NEITHER MyConstant NOR THE PLATFORM IS A LENDER OR BORROWER
          OF LOANS, AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE PLATFORM DOES NOT MAKE MyConstant
          OR THE PLATFORM A LENDER OR BORROWER OF LOANS.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are an individual accessing or using the NFTy-Lend Platform on
          behalf of, or for the benefit of, any corporation, partnership or
          other entity with which you are associated (an "Organization"), then
          you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of yourself and such
          Organization, and you represent and warrant that you have the legal
          authority to bind such Organization to this Agreement. References to
          "you" and "User" in this Agreement will refer to both the individual
          using the NFTy-Lend Platform and to any such Organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS
          FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 19 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION
          ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR
          ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND.

                of such changes. The "Last Updated" legend above indicates when
                this Agreement was last changed. Your use of the NFTy-Lend
                Platform after any changes to this Agreement will constitute
                your acceptance of such changes. We may, at any time and without
                liability: (a) modify or discontinue all or part of the NFT-Lend
                Platform; (b) charge, modify or waive any fees required to use
                the NFTy-Lend Platform; or (c) offer opportunities to some or

                communicating them to you.

                may have rights and responsibilities as a potential requestor of
                a loan (a " Borrower") or a potential provider of such loans (a
                "Lender"), or both. We may reject, or require that you change,
                any username, password or other information that you provide to
                us in registering. Your username and password are for your

                breach or unauthorized use of or access to your username or
                password, or your account. You will be solely liable for all

                The fees for the NFTy-Lend Platform (collectively, the "Fees")
                are as communicated to you by us from time to time, except that
                if we have a separate written agreement setting forth such fees,
                such agreement will control, and MyConstant reserves the right
                to modify, change, supplement or add to such Fees from time to
                time. We will provide you with notice of any such modifications,
                changes, supplements or additions through the NFTy-Lend
                Platform, via email, or through other reasonable means, and your
                continued use of the NFTy-Lend Platform indicates your
                acceptance of such modifications, changes, supplements or
                additions to the Fees. MyConstant reserves the right to require
                payment in advance.
              </li>
              <li>
                You will be responsible for paying any Fees that arise out of a
                Listing or Transaction in connection with the NFTy-Lend
                Platform, even if terms were finalized or payment was made
                outside of the NFTy-Lend Platform or without coordination or
                facilitation by us. In particular, if you and the Borrower or
                Lender (as the case may be) enter into a Transaction outside of
                the NFTy-Lend Platform that was related to a Listing originally
                posted on the NFTy-Lend Platform, then you shall pay the Fee
                applicable to that Transaction. This provision shall not apply
                to transactions conducted outside of the NFTy-Lend Platform
                pursuant to a binding written agreement between Lender and
                Borrower in effect prior to Lender's and/or Borrower's first
                access to the NFTy-Lend Platform (as certified by an officer of
                Borrower and Lender upon MyConstant's request). If MyConstant
                believes that you acted to circumvent such policy, you may be
                subject to a range of actions, including limits on your access
                to the NFTy-Lend Platform, buying and selling privileges and
                Listing and account features, termination or suspension of your
                account, financial penalties, the recovery of lost current and
                future revenue and expenses for policy monitoring and
                enforcement.
              </li>
              <li>
                MyConstant is not a party to any Transaction, and does not
                represent that MyConstant collects taxes, whether municipal,
                state, federal, or otherwise, with respect to any Transactions.
                You and any other users that are parties to a Transaction are
                responsible for any taxes, if any, with respect to such
                Transaction. You must agree to our payment method when buying or
                bidding through the NFTy-Lend Platform, and pay all fees and
                applicable taxes no later than when the Transaction consummates.

                MyConstant reserves the right, upon reasonable prior notice to
                you and during normal business hours, to itself (or through its
                designees) audit your usage of the NFTy-Lend Platform (including
                your buying and selling and other Transactions on the NFTy-Lend
                Platform) for the purpose of verifying your compliance with this
                Agreement. If such audit reveals that you have improperly used
                the NFTy-Lend Platform, or failed to make payments as required
                under this Agreement, such conduct shall be considered a
                material breach of this Agreement and MyConstant may choose, in
                its sole discretion to terminate or suspend your access to the
                NFTy-Lend Platform and/or this Agreement, and/or invoice you for
                such unauthorized use based upon MyConstant's standard fees in
                effect at the time of the audit, which you shall promptly pay to
                MyConstant. If the underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of
                the fees actually paid, you shall also pay MyConstant's
                reasonable costs of conducting the audit.

            <b>Confidentiality</b>

              <li>
                Each of you and us may have access to information (in any form)
                that relates to the others' past, present, and future activities
                including research, development, business activities, products,
                services, processes, know-how and technical knowledge, which is
                identified by the disclosing party as confidential or should
                reasonably be understood to be confidential ("Confidential
                Information"). Confidential Information may only be used by the
                receiving party consistent with the rights and obligations of
                this Agreement. Our Confidential Information includes a
                software, NFTy-Lend Platform, and any related documentation made
                available by MyConstant to you. The receiving party agrees to
                protect the Confidential Information of the disclosing party in
                the same manner that it protects its own similar confidential
                information, but in no event using less than a reasonable
                standard of care. The receiving party must restrict access to
                such Confidential Information to its personnel (including
                personnel employed by its affiliates) and subcontractors with a
                reasonable need to use such Confidential Information (including
                third-party data analytics vendors) pursuant to the receiving
                party's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and must
                ensure that such personnel and subcontractors are bound by
                substantially similar obligations of confidentiality. Nothing in
                this Agreement will prohibit or limit either party's use of
                Confidential Information (a) previously known to it without an
                obligation of confidentiality; (b) independently developed by or
                for it without use of Confidential Information; (c) acquired by
                it from a third party that was not, to the receiving party's
                knowledge, under an obligation of confidentiality; or (d) that
                is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this
                Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding anything in this
                Agreement to the contrary, we shall have the right to use and
                disclose for any purpose, on an anonymized or aggregated basis,
                any data collected in connection with use of the NFT-Lend
                Platform, including any Listings or Transactions.

                to identify you as a user of the NFTy-Lend Platform; and (b) as
                part of authorized press releases (as described below). You
                agree that MyConstant may issue a press release after the
                effective date of this Agreement that announces the business
                relationship formed by this Agreement. MyConstant agrees that
                its use of User Marks, including the goodwill and reputation
                associated therewith, shall be in accordance with your generally
                applicable trademark guidelines. Unless otherwise agreed in
                writing, MyConstant will cease using the User Marks as provided
                in this Section within a commercially reasonable period after
                termination of this Agreement.

                or validity of any provision of this Agreement or your use of

                applicability of your agreement to arbitrate any such dispute,
                claim or controversy (an "Arbitrable Dispute") shall be resolved
                by arbitration in the New York County, State of New York in
                accordance with JAMS' Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and
                Procedures (the "JAMS Rules") then in effect, except that the
                provisions contained in this Agreement shall govern over any
                conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be contained in the
                JAMS Rules. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the
                arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over
                the subject matter thereof. The arbitrator shall have the
                authority to grant any equitable and legal remedies that would
                be available if any judicial proceeding were instituted to
                resolve an Arbitrable Dispute. The existence of any such
                arbitration and the terms of the Arbitrable Dispute shall be
                kept confidential by the parties, except as may be required by
                Applicable Law.

                promptly exchange relevant documents. The arbitrator shall be
                instructed to hold an up to eight (8) hour, one day hearing
                regarding the disputed matter within sixty (60) days after its

                the issue(s) in question, and shall be binding upon the Parties;
                (v) not be contested by the parties; and (vi) remain
                confidential unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties,
                and an order with respect thereto may be entered in any court of

                The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA")
                provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material
                appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
                copyright law. If you believe in good faith that material
                available on the NFTy-Lend Platform infringes your copyright,
                you (or your agent) may send to MyConstant a written notice by
                mail or e-mail, requesting that we remove such material or block
                access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has
                wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you,
                the DMCA permits you to send to MyConstant a counter-notice.
                Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory

                contract for services with any employee of ours, whose duties
                and responsibilities are directly or indirectly connected with
                the NFTy-Lend Platform. General solicitation through newspaper
                advertising, job fairs and similar means, or employment or
                offers resulting from such solicitation, shall not be deemed to
                be a violation of this provision.

                No delay, neglect or forbearance on the part of either party in
                enforcing any term of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a
                waiver. All waivers must be in writing and must be signed by the
                party against which it is sought to be enforced to be effective.
              </li>
              <li>
                The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this
                Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
                other provision hereof, and it is the intent and agreement of
                the parties that this Agreement will be deemed amended by
                modifying such provision to the extent necessary to render it
                valid, legal and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if
                such modification is not possible, by substituting another
                provision that is legal and enforceable and that achieves the
                same objective.
