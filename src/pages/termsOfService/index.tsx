                The fees for the NFT Pawn Platform (collectively, the "Fees")
                are as communicated to you by us from time to time, except that
                if we have a separate written agreement setting forth such fees,
                such agreement will control, and NFT Pawn reserves the right
                to modify, change, supplement or add to such Fees from time to
                time. We will provide you with notice of any such modifications,
                changes, supplements or additions through the NFT Pawn
                Platform, via email, or through other reasonable means, and your
                continued use of the NFT Pawn Platform indicates your
                acceptance of such modifications, changes, supplements or
                additions to the Fees. NFT Pawn reserves the right to require
                payment in advance.

                You will be responsible for paying any Fees that arise out of a
                Listing or Transaction in connection with the NFT Pawn
                Platform, even if terms were finalized or payment was made
                outside of the NFT Pawn Platform or without coordination or
                facilitation by us. In particular, if you and the Borrower or
                Lender (as the case may be) enter into a Transaction outside of
                the NFT Pawn Platform that was related to a Listing originally
                posted on the NFT Pawn Platform, then you shall pay the Fee
                applicable to that Transaction. This provision shall not apply
                to transactions conducted outside of the NFT Pawn Platform
                pursuant to a binding written agreement between Lender and
                Borrower in effect prior to Lender's and/or Borrower's first
                access to the NFT Pawn Platform (as certified by an officer of
                Borrower and Lender upon NFT Pawn's request). If NFT Pawn
                believes that you acted to circumvent such policy, you may be
                subject to a range of actions, including limits on your access
                to the NFT Pawn Platform, buying and selling privileges and
                Listing and account features, termination or suspension of your
                account, financial penalties, the recovery of lost current and
                future revenue and expenses for policy monitoring and
                enforcement.

                NFT Pawn is not a party to any Transaction, and does not

                You and any other users that are parties to a Transaction are

                Transaction. You must agree to our payment method when buying or
                bidding through the NFT Pawn Platform, and pay all fees and

                your buying and selling and other Transactions on the NFT Pawn
                Platform) for the purpose of verifying your compliance with this
                Agreement. If such audit reveals that you have improperly used
                the NFT Pawn Platform, or failed to make payments as required
                under this Agreement, such conduct shall be considered a
                material breach of this Agreement and NFT Pawn may choose, in
                its sole discretion to terminate or suspend your access to the
                NFT Pawn Platform and/or this Agreement, and/or invoice you for
                such unauthorized use based upon NFT Pawn's standard fees in
                effect at the time of the audit, which you shall promptly pay to
                NFT Pawn. If the underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of
                the fees actually paid, you shall also pay NFT Pawn's
                reasonable costs of conducting the audit.
